# Project Dicussion Thoughts:

## 2 Big Questions

 ### 1. How do we know that an APT is present?
 #### a. A struggle in answering this questions stems from the difference the types in malicious behavior. It's easier to detect bad behavior than pin point to APT specific behvaior.

## Database schema ideas

```

--------------------------------------
| APT | Possible Techniques | Events |
--------------------------------------
|APT 3| 	45	    |	~50  |
--------------------------------------

```

## Probabilities

### What is the probability that we have detected an APT?

## Idea 1:

```
[ num of techniques found / num of possible techniques ] * [ num of categories hit / num of categories ]

```

## Idea 2 (refined):

```
[ num of observed techniques / num of possible techniques ] * [ num of observed techniques / categories of possible techniques ] * [ categories of possible techniques / num of possible categories ]

```
